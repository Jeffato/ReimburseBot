Current branch (admin_db) TODO

- User input on admin side to approve/reject/edit request -> DONE
    -> Discord embedds?
    -> Also will need to view image in the db

- Accessing approval queue + link with db
    -> Receipts with under-review tag in db

- Updating DB after user interactions

- Restricting commands to given user
    -> I know this can be done by checking the user id.
    -> Alternative, look at users with specific channels or roles

- Cashflow projections
    -> Outstanding payment totals
    -> Breakdown by budget category
    -> Will need a representation for the overall budget tho, also uploading initial budget totals

Past/Future TODO
