#ReimburseBot

A rewrite of a Discord chatbot written in Python used to automate reimbursement requests, updates to ledgers, and generate reimbursement documents. I aim to create a tool that hopefully reduces the administrative overhead required for my fellow club treasurers and my current successors. To this end, this new bot has to run independent of my local machine. 

Goals
Practice using git
Reviewing object-oriented design principles
Integrating code with AWS services such as s3 buckets
