# ReimburseBot

A rewrite of a Discord chatbot written in Python used to automate reimbursement requests, updates to ledgers, and generate reimbursement documents. I aim to create a tool that hopefully reduces the administrative overhead required for my fellow club treasurers and my immediate successors. Eventually, I hope to deploy this bot so that it does not need to run on my (or other's) local machines.

Beyond completing the bot itself, I also want to experiment more with the technology I learned about in and out of class. This includes practicing git and writing more thoughtful and descriptive commits, object-oriented design principles, working with Postgres, pgadmin for databases, pytesseract for OCR of receipts, and cloud storage with AWS.
